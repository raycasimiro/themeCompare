# themeCompare
This tool can check if two themes are identical. This can be used to check if the 
live theme was successfully updated by comparing its metadata, styles, and paneldefault keys with the test theme.
It works like any other JSON comparison tool but it removes keys that are not style-related e.g. theme name, created_at, modified_at, and etc.
